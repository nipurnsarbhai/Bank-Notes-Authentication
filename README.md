A single hidden layer perceptron network with an adaptive activation function

## About
Model is an implementation of an adaptive activation function with two learn-able parameters k0 and k1 on the hidden layer.
Activation function is mathematically represented as:
  
  g(x) = k0 + k1 * x
  
Softmax activation function is applied on the output layer.
